    Question 18:
    - Consider adding exponentiation to the differentiation program with ** as
    the exponentiation operator. Which of the following cases is correct for the
    make-exponentiation working on an expression p that has a base of zero?

    When the expression has a base of zero (assuming the exponent is not also
    zero), simply return 0 (since 0^n = 0 for all n != 0)
