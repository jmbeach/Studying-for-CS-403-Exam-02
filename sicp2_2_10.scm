    SICP Quiz 2.2

    Question 10:
    - Consider the singly-linked list 2→5→3→nil.
    - Draw a cons cell representation of this list, assuming there is
    a head and a tail pointer. Use the style of the text.
    - Use the variable items to point to this list

    I am not quite sure which bit of the text we are supposed to base
    this on, I have included a drawing of my best guess in "SICP 2.2 10.pdf"
